# selenium-js
NodeJs selenium wrapper with major browser drivers included. Presently only for WindowsOS and configures chrome , firefox, phantomjs and edge. 

Currently this package is for local development and testing running selenium in standalone mode but can easily be modified to include other browser driver versions (ability to choose between them) and quickly set up and configure a selenium-grid. 

`npm install selenium-js@1.0.2 -g`

To run the server:
`selenium-js`
